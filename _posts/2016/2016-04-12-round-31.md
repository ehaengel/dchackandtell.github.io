_Voting at events with Flic buttons_

Harlan Harris, co-founder of Data Science DC, was looking for a convenient way for people to vote on things at a meetup. He decided to create a sort of electronic voting booth using Flic buttons, [a project recently funded on indiegogo](https://flic.io/). These buttons send a message to the owner's phone, and the Flic phone app comes with a number of default actions that can be performed when a message is received. One of these actions is to pass on the message to [If This Then That](https://ifttt.com/), and online tool for doing some simple parsing and automation.

He was able to create an IFTTT recipe that adds a row to a Google spreadsheet when one of the Flic buttons is pressed. He then put together a simple website based on the [Shiny R web application framework](http://shiny.rstudio.com/). Long story, but it works!

He set up his Flic buttons at the entrance to WeWork so that people could vote when they came in. The votes were tallied in real time, and were displayed on the projector. Unfortunately Google's event queue has a delay in it, so the website only updates every few minutes. Also, Harlan would prefer to have some really big, red buttons, as they'd be much more satisfying the press.
